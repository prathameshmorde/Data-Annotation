# Data-Annotation
The goal of this project is to test the ability to build a binary classification dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images. This could be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product. 

This classification system 
- Can flag serious cases.
- Identify healthy cases.
- Act as a diagnostic aid for doctors.

I used Appen's platform(https://appen.com/) to create a data labelling job. The goal of data annotation is to bring you from unlabeled data to a desired, labeled output. This platform will send your data to human annotators that can help transform unlabeled data.

The project consists of - 
1. Proposal - It highlights the details about my design considerations and strategies I used for quality assurance.
2. Instructions - The template designed for contributors or human annotators who will use the tool to identify the pneumonia.
